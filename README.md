My name is Denis, I am from the city of Barnaul. I have been interested in computers and modern technologies since my childhood./
I graduated from ***Altai State University*** with a degree in computer science and computer engineering. So far I haven't development experience, but university disciplines mastered well, especially liked *programming*, so I decided to further develop in this area. At the moment I am undergoing training in **neural network development**.
